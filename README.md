This is a Game of Rock, Paper, Scissors created built from vanilla Javascript.

Picked up a few tricks for manipulating the DOM during this project although it wasn't anything extraordinary.

The game itself is pretty straight forward; 

You will be playing against the computer by selecting 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors' via the corresponding buttons on the page.
After Selecting a message will be displayed revealing whether you won or lost or if it was a draw.
